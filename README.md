## Introduction
Skin conditions can significantly affect an individual's quality of life, leading to physical discomfort and psychological stress. Despite the prevalence of skin diseases, many people face barriers to accessing dermatological care. The Skin Health Prediction App addresses these challenges by providing users with easy access to skin health analysis and professional medical advice.

## Technologies Used
* Machine Learning: TensorFlow is used for developing the CNN model for image classification.
* Mobile App Development: Android Studio is used for building the mobile application.
* Database Management: Firebase is used for secure storage and real-time data synchronization.
* Programming Languages: Python and Java are used for various components of the app.

## Methodology
The app uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze images of skin conditions submitted by users. The CNN model is trained on a large dataset of labeled skin condition images, enabling it to distinguish between different types of skin issues. The app also integrates features for dermatologist consultations and educational resources to support comprehensive skin health management.
